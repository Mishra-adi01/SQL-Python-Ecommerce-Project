# SQL-Python-Ecommerce-Project


This project is all about diving into e-commerce data to figure out what's happening behind the scenes—think customer behavior, sales patterns, and product performance. With a mix of Python and SQL, I've worked on making sense of raw data to pull out insights that can actually make a difference.

What's Inside?
Combining Data: Pulled together information from different sources like databases and CSV files.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Cleaned, prepped, and visualized the data using tools like pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Basically turned messy data into meaningful stories.

SQL Queries: Ran a bunch of SQL scripts to grab the details that mattered most—no wasted time here!

Meaningful Insights: Found trends and patterns that can be super useful for decisions and strategy.

Tools Used
Python: My go-to for everything scripting, analysis, and visualization.

pandas (data manipulation hero).

Matplotlib & Seaborn (my colorful toolkit for charts).

NumPy (because crunching numbers is fun!).

SQL: Perfect for handling and querying structured data.

Jupyter Notebook: Keeps everything neat and interactive—love it!

Cool Things I Discovered
Customers’ buying habits and seasonal trends that drive sales.
Which products consistently stand out (and which don’t)
